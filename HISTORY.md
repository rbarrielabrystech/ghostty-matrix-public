# Part I: The Matrix Philosophy

## Why Terminals Matter

Before there were graphical interfaces, before mice and touchscreens and swiping, there was the terminal. A blinking cursor on a dark screen. A direct line between human thought and machine execution.

The terminal is the most honest interface ever created. There is no abstraction, no metaphor, no skeuomorphism. You type a command. The machine responds. There is nothing between you and the machine except language itself.

Every computing revolution began at a terminal. The first programs were entered switch by switch on front panels. The first operating systems were commanded through teletypes. The first networks were navigated through text. The first hackers, the first programmers, the first system administrators — they all sat in front of terminals.

The Wachowskis understood this. In *The Matrix*, the terminal is not just a tool — it is the *truth*. When Neo sees the Matrix for what it really is, he doesn't see a graphical interface. He sees cascading green text. Raw code. The terminal view of reality.

This project is a time machine. Each era takes you back to a different moment in the history of human-computer interaction — from hand-wired cipher machines to the dawn of the modern internet. Not as a museum exhibit behind glass, but as a living, interactive experience. You don't just read about punch cards. You punch them.

## The Matrix and Terminal Culture

When *The Matrix* premiered on March 31, 1999, it crystallized something that hacker culture had known for decades: the terminal is where reality is negotiated.

The film's production design was meticulous. The "digital rain" — those cascading half-width katakana characters — was created by scanning sushi recipes from Simon Whiteley's wife's Japanese cookbooks, then digitally manipulating the characters. The green-on-black color scheme wasn't arbitrary. It was a direct reference to the green phosphor CRT monitors that had defined computing for a generation.

In the film, every interaction with the Matrix's underlying reality happens through a terminal interface. Trinity's opening hack uses real tools — `nmap` for port scanning, `sshnuke` for exploitation. When Neo finally sees the Matrix as code, the green rain is the visual representation of seeing through the interface to the machine beneath.

But the connection between *The Matrix* and terminal culture runs deeper than aesthetic. The film's central question — "What is real?" — is the same question that every programmer confronts. What is a file? What is a process? What is memory? These things don't exist in any physical sense. They are abstractions, consensual hallucinations maintained by the machine. The terminal is where you negotiate with those abstractions directly.

The hacker community recognized themselves in Neo. He was the programmer who stayed up late, staring at a green-black screen, feeling that there was something more behind the code. The "red pill" became permanent slang for seeing uncomfortable truth. "There is no spoon" became a programmer's koan about the nature of abstraction.

*The Matrix* didn't create terminal culture. It canonized it.

## The Green Phosphor Aesthetic

Why green? Of all the colors a computer screen could glow, why did green become the color of computing itself?

The answer is phosphor chemistry. Early CRT monitors used a single electron gun firing at a phosphor-coated screen. The most efficient and long-lasting phosphor compound available was **P1 phosphor** (zinc silicate), which glowed green. It was bright, it was stable, it had excellent persistence (the glow lingered just long enough to prevent flicker without causing smearing), and it was cheap to manufacture.

P1 green phosphor peaked at around 525 nanometers — a wavelength near the center of human visual sensitivity. Your eyes are more sensitive to green light than any other color, which meant green phosphor monitors could be driven at lower power while remaining highly readable. In an era when every watt mattered and monitors ran hot, this was a practical advantage.

The green-on-black aesthetic became the default for an entire generation of terminals:

- **1970s**: DEC VT100, IBM 3270, and most minicomputer terminals used P1 or P31 green phosphor
- **1977**: The "Trinity" of home computers (Apple II, PET, TRS-80) — two of three shipped with green monitors
- **1981**: The IBM PC's monochrome display adapter was paired with IBM's green phosphor 5151 monitor

By the time amber phosphor (P3, peaking at ~580nm) became popular in the early 1980s — offering warmer tones and arguably less eye strain — green had already become the *symbol* of computing. When Hollywood needed to show a "computer screen," it was always green text on black. When hackers imagined themselves, they saw green.

The Wachowskis chose green for the Matrix's code not because it was technically superior, but because it was *culturally* correct. Green meant "this is a computer." Green meant "this is real." The irony — that green was the color of the *simulation* — was the point.

## The CRT as Sacred Object

The cathode ray tube is a violent piece of technology. An electron gun fires a beam at nearly the speed of light toward a glass screen coated in rare-earth phosphors. Magnetic coils deflect the beam in precise patterns — 525 lines in NTSC, 625 in PAL — while the phosphors glow and fade in microsecond cycles. The glass envelope holds a near-perfect vacuum, storing enough energy to implode dangerously if cracked.

And yet, for fifty years, this was how humans looked at computation. The CRT was the window between the digital and physical worlds. It had *character*. Each tube was slightly different — minor variations in phosphor coating, electron gun alignment, magnetic field uniformity. The image was always slightly soft, slightly warm. Scanlines were visible at close range. The screen curved because the glass had to be thick enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum.

CRT displays had *presence*. They hummed at their horizontal scan frequency (15.7 kHz for standard NTSC — just at the edge of human hearing, a sound many people could detect as a faint whine). They crackled with static electricity — run your hand across a CRT screen and your hair would stand up. They were warm to the touch. When you turned one off, the image didn't just vanish — it collapsed. The brightness spiked as the deflection circuits lost power, then the image crushed down to a horizontal line, then a single bright dot in the center that slowly faded as the phosphors gave up their stored energy. That shutdown sequence was so distinctive, so universally experienced, that it became a cultural icon.

Our `crt-shutdown.glsl` shader recreates this exact sequence because it was a shared experience for an entire generation. You didn't just close a window. You watched the light die.

The CRT effects in this project — the barrel distortion, the scanlines, the shadow mask pattern, the vignette, the phosphor glow — aren't nostalgia for nostalgia's sake. They're a faithful reproduction of how computation *looked* when it was a physical process happening inside a glass tube three feet from your face. Modern flat panels are technically superior in every measurable way. But they have no soul. A CRT had soul.

## Red Pill, Blue Pill: CLI vs GUI

> *"You take the blue pill — the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill — you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."* — Morpheus

The history of computing is, in many ways, the history of abstraction. Each generation builds a layer on top of the last, hiding complexity, making things "easier." Switches gave way to assembly language. Assembly gave way to high-level languages. Command lines gave way to graphical interfaces. GUIs gave way to touch. Touch is giving way to voice and gesture.

Each layer of abstraction is a blue pill. It makes the machine more accessible but less transparent. The GUI is a beautiful lie — a metaphor of desktops, folders, and trash cans that bears no relationship to how a computer actually works. Files aren't in folders. Programs don't have windows. The desktop is empty. It's all voltage patterns in silicon, interpreted through layers of abstraction so deep that most users never glimpse the machine beneath.

The terminal is the red pill. It doesn't pretend. It doesn't use metaphors. It shows you the machine as close to raw as a human interface can get. When you `ls` a directory, you're not looking at icons — you're reading the filesystem's actual directory entries. When you `ps aux`, you see the real process table. When you pipe `grep` through `awk` through `sort`, you're composing machine operations in real time, like speaking the machine's own language.

This is why hackers love terminals. This is why Neo sees the Matrix as cascading code, not as a graphical interface. The truth is always text.

The terminal eras in this project trace the evolution from the *most* transparent interfaces (front panels where you literally toggled in binary) through increasingly abstracted ones (command lines, BASIC interpreters, DOS prompts, GUIs). Each era represents a different answer to the fundamental question: how much of the machine should the human see?

## 1999: The Year Everything Changed

The Matrix wasn't released into a vacuum. 1999 was the hinge of computing history — the last year of the old world and the first year of the new.

**What was ending:**
- CRT monitors were still standard but LCDs were appearing
- Dial-up modems were the norm (56K was state-of-the-art) but DSL and cable were emerging
- Windows 98 was on most desktops, but Windows 2000 was around the corner
- Command-line Linux was for experts, but GNOME and KDE were making it graphical
- BBS culture was fading, but it hadn't completely died
- The dot-com bubble was inflating to its peak

**What was beginning:**
- Google had incorporated the previous year
- Napster launched in June 1999
- Wi-Fi (802.11b) was standardized that year
- The Y2K panic was reaching fever pitch
- The human genome project was nearing completion
- Slashdot, the hacker news site, was at its peak

*The Matrix* captured this exact moment — the threshold between the analog and digital worlds, between the physical and the virtual, between knowing and not knowing. The film asked: what if the digital world is more real than the physical one? In 1999, that question was becoming less philosophical and more practical.

This project's default theme is 1999: the Matrix green, the CRT shader, the digital rain. But the terminal eras let you trace the path *to* 1999 — from Enigma machines through mainframes, through home computers, through the internet, to the moment when a science fiction film made everyone stare at a terminal and wonder what was on the other side.

# Part II: The Eras

Each era in this project is not just a color scheme and a boot message. It's a moment in the history of human-computer interaction, faithfully recreated so you can experience it — not just read about it.

## WWII Computing (1940s)

The first era of computing wasn't about convenience. It was about survival. The machines built during World War II were created to break codes, calculate firing tables, and simulate nuclear reactions. They were built in secret, operated by mathematicians in military uniforms, and their very existence was classified for decades.

### 1. Enigma Machine (1918-1945)

**Year**: Patented 1918 by Arthur Scherbius; adopted by German military 1926-1945
**Origin**: Berlin, Germany
**Type**: Electromechanical rotor cipher machine

The Enigma machine wasn't a computer. It was something stranger — an electromechanical device that turned the act of encryption into something as simple as typing. Press a key, a lamp lights up showing the encrypted letter. Press the same key again, and a different lamp lights — because with each keypress, the internal rotors advance, changing the substitution alphabet.

**How it worked:**

The Enigma M3, used by the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, contained three rotors selected from a set of five (later eight for the Navy's M4 variant), a reflector, and a plugboard. Each rotor contained 26 electrical contacts on each side, with internal wiring that performed a letter substitution. The signal path was:

1. **Keyboard** → the operator presses a letter
2. **Plugboard** (Steckerbrett) → up to 13 pairs of letters could be swapped
3. **Right rotor** → first substitution
4. **Middle rotor** → second substitution
5. **Left rotor** → third substitution
6. **Reflector** (Umkehrwalze) → bounces the signal back
7. **Left → Middle → Right rotors** → three more substitutions (inverse path)
8. **Plugboard** → final swap
9. **Lampboard** → the encrypted letter illuminates

The beauty of this design was that the same machine could encrypt and decrypt — type the ciphertext back with the same settings and you'd get the plaintext. The reflector guaranteed that no letter could ever encrypt to itself, which was actually a cryptographic weakness that the Allies exploited.

The rotors stepped like an odometer: the right rotor advanced with every keypress, the middle rotor advanced when the right rotor hit its turnover notch, and the left rotor advanced when the middle rotor hit its turnover notch. The famous "double-stepping anomaly" caused the middle rotor to step twice in succession when it was at its turnover position — a mechanical quirk that had to be accounted for in any accurate simulation.

**The numbers:**

With three rotors chosen from five (60 arrangements), 26^3 starting positions (17,576), and the plugboard's astronomical combinations, the Enigma had approximately **158,962,555,217,826,360,000** possible settings. The Germans believed this made it unbreakable.

They were wrong.

**Breaking Enigma:**

Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski first broke Enigma in 1932 using pure mathematics, exploiting the fact that the Germans repeated the message key twice at the start of each transmission. His team built electromechanical devices called "bombas" to automate the search. In 1939, with war imminent, Poland shared their breakthrough with Britain and France.

At Bletchley Park, Alan Turing refined the approach, building the British "Bombe" — an electromechanical device that could test Enigma settings far faster than any human. The codebreakers exploited multiple weaknesses: the reflector's no-self-encryption property, predictable message formats ("weather report" always appeared at the same time), and lazy operators who used the same settings or chose obvious starting positions (AAA, or their girlfriend's initials).

**Cultural significance:**

Ultra intelligence — derived from broken Enigma messages — is estimated to have shortened the war by two years and saved millions of lives. The breaking of Enigma was the first great triumph of computational thinking over brute complexity, and it set the intellectual foundation for the entire field of computer science.

**Our simulator:** Implements the real M3 rotor wirings (I through V), reflectors B and C, a 13-pair plugboard, and proper double-stepping. You can encrypt a message, then type the ciphertext back to verify decryption — exactly as a German operator would have done in 1944.

### 2. Colossus (1943-1945)

**Year**: First operational December 1943 (Mk 1); June 1944 (Mk 2)
**Origin**: Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England
**Creator**: Tommy Flowers, Post Office Research Station
**Type**: Electronic digital computer (special-purpose)

Colossus wasn't built to break Enigma — it was built to break something harder. The Lorenz SZ42 cipher machine, codenamed "Tunny" by the British, was used for high-level strategic communications between Hitler and his generals. It was far more complex than Enigma, using twelve rotors instead of three.

Tommy Flowers, a telephone engineer at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, proposed building a machine using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) — 1,500 of them for the Mk 1, 2,400 for the Mk 2. His superiors thought he was mad. Valves were fragile, unreliable, and expensive. No one had built anything with so many valves. But Flowers knew that valves failed primarily when being switched on and off, so he kept Colossus running continuously. It worked.

Colossus read encrypted messages from paper tape at 5,000 characters per second — the tape physically flew through the reader at nearly 30 miles per hour. The machine performed Boolean logic operations on the data, counting statistical patterns that revealed the Lorenz machine's settings.

Ten Colossi were built by the end of the war. After VJ Day, eight were dismantled on Winston Churchill's orders, and the remaining two were classified so deeply that their existence wasn't publicly acknowledged until the 1970s. Tommy Flowers was forbidden from telling anyone what he had built. He couldn't even use his wartime experience to get a bank loan.

Colossus was the world's first programmable electronic digital computer, though this was unknown for decades because of the official secrecy, leading many to credit ENIAC (1945) with that distinction.

**Our simulator:** Displays the authentic boot sequence of a Colossus — "GOVERNMENT CODE AND CYPHER SCHOOL" at "STATION X" (Bletchley Park's official designation). The 5,000 characters-per-second tape speed is referenced in the boot text.

## Pre-CRT Era (1950s-1960s)

Before screens, computers spoke on paper. Every bit of output was physical — punched into cards, hammered onto paper through ink ribbons, or clattered out on mechanical printers. You could hold a program in your hands. You could hear a computer thinking.

### 3. IBM Punch Card (1890s-1970s)

**Year**: Hollerith cards patented 1889; IBM 029 Keypunch introduced 1964
**Origin**: Herman Hollerith, Washington D.C. (later IBM, Armonk, New York)
**Type**: Paper-based data storage and input

The punch card is where data processing began. Herman Hollerith invented the punched card system to tabulate the 1890 United States Census. The previous census (1880) had taken eight years to process manually. The Census Bureau feared the 1890 count might not be complete before the 1900 census began. Hollerith's machine completed the initial count in six weeks.

**The card:**

The standard IBM card was 7-3/8 inches long, 3-1/4 inches wide, and 0.007 inches thick — dimensions that remained unchanged for over 80 years. Each card had 80 columns and 12 rows. The Hollerith encoding scheme used combinations of punches in these rows to represent characters:

- **Digits (0-9)**: A single punch in the corresponding row (row 0 through row 9)
- **Letters A-I**: A punch in zone row 12 plus digit rows 1-9
- **Letters J-R**: A punch in zone row 11 plus digit rows 1-9
- **Letters S-Z**: A punch in zone row 0 plus digit rows 2-9
- **Special characters**: Various combinations of zone and digit punches

The famous corner cut on the upper-left of each card served two purposes: it told you which way was "up" in the dark, and a card inserted backwards would jam the reader — a feature, not a bug.

**The IBM 029 Keypunch:**

Released in 1964 alongside the System/360, the IBM 029 Keypunch was the standard card punch for a generation. An operator sat at a keyboard resembling a typewriter, and as they typed, the machine punched rectangular holes in the card and advanced to the next column. The mechanical action was precise and satisfying — a distinctive "ka-chunk" for each character.

The 029 had a "program drum" that could be loaded with a punched card to define field formats — automatically duplicating headers, skipping columns, and switching between alphabetic and numeric entry. Skilled operators could punch 100-150 cards per hour. The machine was so well-designed that operators could type at full speed without watching the card — the sound and feel of each punch was feedback enough.

**The 80-column legacy:**

Why do terminal windows default to 80 columns? Because of the punch card. The 80-column standard propagated from cards to video terminals (the IBM 3270 had an 80-column display), to the VT100, to every terminal emulator since. Every time you see 80-character line limits in a style guide, you're looking at a ghost of the punch card.

**Our simulator:** Implements real Hollerith encoding with a visual 80-column card showing all 12 rows. You type characters and see the actual punch pattern appear. Cards can be released to a deck and submitted to a simulated card reader. JCL (Job Control Language) cards starting with `//` trigger job processing with authentic ABEND error messages.

---

### 4. Teletype ASR-33 (1963)

**Year**: 1963
**Manufacturer**: Teletype Corporation (subsidiary of Western Electric/AT&T)
**Speed**: 10 characters per second (110 baud)
**Type**: Electromechanical teleprinter

The Teletype Model 33 was the terminal that brought computing to the masses — or at least, to the first generation of programmers who didn't need a PhD and a security clearance to use a computer.

**The machine:**

The ASR-33 (Automatic Send-Receive) was a marvel of electromechanical engineering. It combined a keyboard, a printer, a paper tape reader, and a paper tape punch in a single desk-sized unit. The printing mechanism used a type cylinder (similar to a typewriter ball) that rotated and translated to select characters, then struck an ink ribbon against continuous-roll paper.

It printed at 10 characters per second — 100 milliseconds per character. This sounds slow, and it was, but it was fast enough for interactive computing and slow enough that you could read the output as it appeared. The characteristic sound — a rapid-fire mechanical clatter like a machine gun crossed with a sewing machine — became the soundtrack of early computing.

The ASR-33 used 7-bit ASCII (it was one of the first devices to implement the then-new ASCII standard) but only supported uppercase characters. This limitation shaped computing culture: early Unix commands are short and lowercase because they were designed for terminals that didn't have lowercase. The `UPPER CASE ONLY` convention persisted in mainframe computing well into the 1980s.

**The paper tape:**

The ASR-33's paper tape reader and punch used 8-channel tape (7 data bits + 1 parity bit) with small circular sprocket holes for the feed mechanism. Programs could be saved to paper tape and loaded back later — the earliest form of portable storage. The tapes were fragile, prone to tearing, and could only be read sequentially, but they were cheap and unlimited in length.

Paper tape had a tactile quality that no modern storage medium can match. You could hold your program, see the holes, even read it by eye if you knew the encoding. Experienced programmers could spot errors in paper tape by looking at the pattern of holes.

**Connection to Unix:**

When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie developed Unix at Bell Labs in 1969-1971, their primary terminal was a Teletype Model 33. This is why Unix uses `LF` (Line Feed, ASCII 10) as its line ending rather than `CR+LF` (Carriage Return + Line Feed) — on the Teletype, the carriage return was a mechanical operation that took real time (the print head had to physically return to the left margin), so Unix handled it in software. The `/dev/tty` device name in Unix literally stands for "teletype."

**Our simulator:** Faithfully recreates the 10 cps output speed, uppercase-only input, and carriage return delays. The paper tape display shows 8-bit ASCII patterns using filled and open circles. It can connect to the BASIC interpreter in teletype mode for the full 1960s programming experience.

### 5. IBM 1403 Line Printer (1959)

**Year**: 1959 (with System/1401); widely used through the 1970s
**Manufacturer**: IBM
**Speed**: 600 lines per minute (Model N1) to 1,100 lines per minute (Model 2)
**Type**: Chain/train impact printer

If the Teletype was the voice of interactive computing, the line printer was the voice of batch processing. In the mainframe era, you didn't sit at a screen and watch your program run. You submitted a deck of punch cards, waited (hours or days), and then picked up your output from the printer room.

**The mechanism:**

The IBM 1403 used a continuously rotating chain (or "print train") of 240 character slugs that whipped past the paper at high speed. As each character on the chain passed a print position, a tiny hammer would fire at precisely the right moment, pressing the paper and ink ribbon against the moving chain to transfer the character. All 132 print positions had independent hammers that could fire simultaneously, allowing an entire line to be printed in a single revolution of the chain.

The sound was extraordinary — a sustained, high-pitched roar like a swarm of mechanical bees. When printing, the 1403 produced a distinctive oscillating hum that varied with the content being printed. Experienced operators could identify programs by the sound of their output. Clever programmers discovered that by printing specific patterns, they could make the printer play recognizable music — one of the earliest forms of computer art.

**Greenbar paper:**

The paper was pre-printed with alternating bands of white and pale green — "greenbar paper" — to help operators read across long lines of numbers. This paper, with its continuous-feed tractor holes on each side, became so iconic that it entered popular culture as a symbol of corporate computing. The `132 columns wide × 66 lines per page` format was the standard for mainframe output for decades.

**Art on the 1403:**

Because the printer was character-based and fast, programmers used it to create ASCII art — banner text, Snoopy prints, calendar posters, and surprisingly detailed images built from overprinted characters. The practice of creating images from text characters on line printers is the direct ancestor of ASCII art and ANSI art.

**Our simulator:** Shows the boot sequence of an IBM 1403 with its chain type, speed, and paper configuration. The greenbar aesthetic influences the color palette — reversed from the typical terminal, with dark text on a light background.

## Mainframe Era (1960s-1970s)

The mainframe era was when computing first became an industry. Machines filled rooms, cost millions, and were tended by teams of operators in white coats. But it was also when timesharing was invented — the revolutionary idea that many people could use the same computer simultaneously. The mainframe terminal, glowing green in a windowless room, became the programmer's primary tool.

### 6. IBM 3270 (1971)

**Year**: 1971
**Manufacturer**: IBM
**Type**: Block-mode display terminal
**Display**: Green phosphor CRT, 80×24 or 80×43

The IBM 3270 wasn't just a terminal — it was a paradigm. While other terminals sent characters one at a time (character mode), the 3270 worked in "block mode": the entire screen was a form, and nothing was sent to the host computer until the operator pressed Enter. This dramatically reduced network traffic and made the 3270 practical over slow communication links.

**Block mode operation:**

A 3270 screen was divided into "fields" — protected fields (display only, shown in high intensity) and unprotected fields (editable, shown in normal intensity). The Tab key moved the cursor between unprotected fields. You filled in a form, pressed Enter, and the entire screen was transmitted at once. Program Function keys (PF1-PF24) triggered specific actions.

This model was so efficient that it remained the standard for airline reservations, banking, insurance, and government systems for decades. Even today, many critical systems still use 3270-based interfaces, accessed through terminal emulators running on modern PCs.

**ISPF and TSO:**

Two interfaces defined the 3270 experience:

- **TSO (Time Sharing Option)**: IBM's interactive command-line environment for MVS. The `IKJ56700A ENTER USERID` prompt was the first thing you saw when connecting to a mainframe. Every mainframe programmer of the era typed their user ID into that prompt thousands of times.

- **ISPF (Interactive System Productivity Facility)**: A panel-based interface built on top of TSO. The ISPF Primary Option Menu — options 0 through 6 plus T and X — was the gateway to editing datasets, submitting jobs, viewing output, and managing the system. ISPF was so well-designed that many mainframe shops still use it today.

**The green glow:**

The 3270 was the archetype of the green-on-black terminal. The IBM 3278 display used P39 green phosphor, optimized for long persistence to reduce flicker. The display was sharp, stable, and easy to read for hours. When people picture "a computer screen" from the mainframe era, they're picturing a 3270.

**Our simulator:** Implements authentic TSO login (with `IKJ56700A ENTER USERID` prompt), the ISPF Primary Option Menu with options 0-6, a utilities panel, and a TSO command line. Tab between fields, Enter to submit — just like the real thing.

### 7. IBM System/360 (1964)

**Year**: April 7, 1964
**Manufacturer**: IBM
**Type**: Mainframe computer family
**Significance**: The most important computer ever built

The System/360 was not a computer. It was an *architecture* — a unified family of machines, from small to very large, that all ran the same software. Before the 360, every IBM computer was incompatible with every other IBM computer. If you upgraded, you rewrote all your software. The 360 ended that. It was the first "family" of computers, and the concept of hardware/software compatibility that we take for granted today began here.

**The gamble:**

IBM bet the company on the System/360. The development cost was $5 billion (equivalent to roughly $50 billion today) — more than the Manhattan Project. At the time, IBM's annual revenue was about $3 billion. CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr. later called it "the most important product announcement that IBM ever made" and "perhaps the most important product announcement in the history of the computer industry."

The name "360" referred to 360 degrees — all points of the compass. IBM intended the system to address every possible computing need.

**IPL and the operator console:**

"IPL" — Initial Program Load — was the System/360's term for booting. The operator would enter the IPL device address (typically `0190` for a disk pack) using rotary switches on the operator console, press the LOAD button, and watch as the operating system loaded from disk. The console would print a series of messages beginning with three-letter codes: `IEA` for supervisor messages, `IEE` for operator communication, `IEF` for job management. Learning to read these message codes was a rite of passage for mainframe operators.

**OS/360:**

The operating system, OS/360, was one of the most ambitious software projects ever attempted — and one of the most troubled. Fred Brooks, the project manager, later wrote *The Mythical Man-Month* based on his experience, giving the world Brooks's Law: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." The book remains essential reading for software engineers sixty years later.

**Our simulator:** Displays an authentic IPL sequence from device 0190, with OS/360 MVT Release 21.8 message codes, and the `IEA101A SPECIFY SYSTEM PARAMETERS` prompt that every System/360 operator knew by heart.

### 8. DEC PDP-8 (1965)

**Year**: 1965
**Manufacturer**: Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Maynard, Massachusetts
**CPU**: 12-bit, 1.5 MHz
**Memory**: 4,096 12-bit words (expandable)
**Price**: $18,500 (about $175,000 today)
**Type**: Minicomputer

The PDP-8 was the first computer cheap enough for a single department or lab to own. Before the PDP-8, you used a computer by submitting jobs to a central computing center. The PDP-8 made computing personal — not personal like a PC, but personal like having your own machine in your own lab, available whenever you wanted it.

**The front panel:**

The PDP-8's front panel was its primary interface. A row of lights displayed the current address and data in binary, grouped in threes for octal reading (the PDP-8 used octal, not hexadecimal, because 12 bits divide evenly into groups of 3). Toggle switches below the lights let you enter data and addresses.

To load a program, you:
1. Set the address switches to the starting location
2. Press LOAD ADDRESS to set the program counter
3. Set the data switches to the first instruction
4. Press DEPOSIT to store the word
5. The address automatically advances
6. Repeat for each instruction
7. Set the starting address and press RUN

This was tedious — a 100-instruction program required 100 manual switch-toggle-deposit cycles. But it gave you an intimate understanding of the machine. You were literally constructing the program in memory, bit by bit, through your fingertips.

**Cultural impact:**

The PDP-8 was where the hands-on hacking culture began. At MIT, Harvard, and universities worldwide, students who had previously been locked out of the computing center suddenly had their own machine. They could experiment, fail, iterate, and discover — without waiting for batch job turnaround. The first generation of hackers (in the original, positive sense) cut their teeth on PDP-8 front panels.

DEC sold over 50,000 PDP-8s in various models, making it the first mass-produced minicomputer. Its success proved that computers didn't have to be room-filling mainframes, and it paved the way for the microcomputer revolution that followed.

**Our simulator:** Renders an ASCII front panel with LED indicators (filled/open circles for on/off), an address and data display in octal, and toggle switches controlled by the number keys. Pre-loaded programs include a counter, LED chaser, and "Kill the Bit" — the classic front-panel game where a single lit LED chases across the display and you try to "kill" it by toggling the right switch at the right moment.

## Early Terminals (1970s)

The 1970s saw the transition from teletypes and front panels to the video display terminal — the device that would define human-computer interaction for the next two decades. These terminals didn't compute anything themselves; they were "dumb" terminals connected to a remote computer. But they gave interactive computing its visual language: the glowing screen, the blinking cursor, the scrolling text.

### 9. DEC VT100 (1978)

**Year**: August 1978
**Manufacturer**: Digital Equipment Corporation
**Display**: 12-inch green phosphor CRT, 80×24 or 132×24 characters
**Processor**: Intel 8080 (for terminal control only)
**Price**: $1,895 (about $8,800 today)
**Type**: ANSI-standard video display terminal

The VT100 is the most influential terminal ever made. Not the most powerful, not the most advanced, not the most popular at its peak — but the most *influential*. The VT100 defined the standard for terminal behavior that we still use today. Every terminal emulator you have ever used is, at its core, emulating a VT100.

**Why it mattered:**

Before the VT100, every terminal manufacturer used their own proprietary escape codes for cursor movement, screen clearing, text attributes, and other functions. Software had to be rewritten for every terminal type. DEC implemented the emerging ANSI X3.64 standard (which they had helped develop), and the VT100 became the *de facto* reference implementation.

When you type `\033[2J` to clear a screen, or `\033[1;32m` to set green text, you're using VT100 escape codes. When a program queries `$TERM` and sees `vt100` or `xterm` (which is VT100-compatible), it's honoring a standard that the VT100 established in 1978.

**The self-test:**

When a VT100 powered on, it performed a self-test that filled the screen with `E` characters — every position on the 80×24 display showed a capital E. This tested every character position, the display memory, and the CRT's ability to illuminate the entire screen. After a fraction of a second, the Es disappeared and the terminal was ready. This distinctive boot sequence became the VT100's signature.

**Advanced Video Option:**

The base VT100 supported 80 columns with bold, underline, blink, and reverse video. The "Advanced Video Option" (AVO) added 132-column mode, additional character attributes, and more display memory. The 132-column mode was crucial for reading wide reports and log files, and the 132-column tradition persists in many modern terminals.

**The keyboard:**

The VT100's keyboard layout — with its distinctive arrangement of function keys, cursor keys in an inverted-T pattern, and a separate numeric keypad — influenced keyboard design for decades. The arrow key arrangement (up-down-left-right in an inverted T) became universal.

**Our simulator:** Opens with the authentic VT100 self-test (filling the screen with Es), displays "DEC VT100 / FIRMWARE VERSION 2.0", and then connects to a simulated 4.2 BSD UNIX system on a PDP-11/70 — the classic VT100+BSD combination that defined 1980s university computing. Green phosphor shader active.

### 10. DEC VT220 (1983)

**Year**: November 1983
**Manufacturer**: Digital Equipment Corporation
**Display**: 14-inch amber phosphor CRT (green also available), 80×24 or 132×24
**Type**: ANSI video display terminal

The VT220 was the VT100 refined. Where the VT100 was a revolution, the VT220 was an evolution — faster, more capable, and available with the amber phosphor display that many operators preferred for long sessions.

**Amber phosphor:**

While the VT100 was synonymous with green, the VT220 popularized amber. The amber (P3) phosphor used a zinc cadmium sulfide compound that emitted at approximately 580 nanometers — a warm yellow-orange. Many users found it easier on the eyes during extended use, and ergonomics studies of the era generally (though not unanimously) supported this. The amber VT220 became the standard terminal at many VAX/VMS installations.

**VAX/VMS:**

The VT220 was the natural companion to DEC's VAX minicomputer running the VMS operating system. VAX/VMS was a sophisticated, multi-user system that competed with Unix in the university and corporate markets. Its login prompt (`Username:`) and welcome message (`Welcome to VAX/VMS`) were a daily sight for thousands of programmers and system administrators throughout the 1980s.

VMS was known for its robustness — VAX/VMS systems with uptimes measured in *years* were not uncommon. The system's influence persists in Windows NT, which was designed by Dave Cutler, the chief architect of VMS. (The joke in the industry was that if you shifted each letter in VMS forward by one, you got WNT — Windows NT.)

**Our simulator:** Displays the VT220 self-test, firmware version 2.3, and connects to a simulated VAX/VMS V4.7 system. Amber phosphor shader active, creating the warm golden glow that distinguished VT220 installations.

### 11. MITS Altair 8800 (1975)

**Year**: January 1975 (announced December 1974 in *Popular Electronics*)
**Manufacturer**: MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), Albuquerque, New Mexico
**Designer**: Ed Roberts
**CPU**: Intel 8080 @ 2 MHz
**Memory**: 256 bytes standard (expandable to 64 KB)
**Price**: $621 kit / $795 assembled (about $3,500/$4,500 today)
**Type**: Microcomputer (the first commercially successful one)

The Altair 8800 is where the personal computer revolution began. When the January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* hit newsstands with the Altair on its cover and the headline "World's First Minicomputer Kit to Rival Commercial Models," MITS was flooded with orders. Ed Roberts had expected to sell maybe 200 units. Within months, they had thousands of orders.

**The front panel experience:**

The Altair had no keyboard, no screen, no storage. Its interface was the front panel: a row of red LEDs for address and data, and a row of toggle switches. Programming the Altair meant toggling in machine code one byte at a time:

1. Set the address switches (16 switches for 16-bit addresses)
2. Press EXAMINE to read that address, or DEPOSIT to write the switch values
3. Press DEPOSIT NEXT to advance to the next address

The LEDs displayed binary — address on top, data below. The switches toggled up for 1, center for hold, down for 0. There was something meditative about the process. Toggle, deposit, toggle, deposit. Each instruction was a physical act. You could feel the program taking shape under your fingers.

The first program most Altair owners entered was a simple LED chase — toggle in about a dozen bytes that made a light pattern sweep back and forth across the front panel LEDs. It took ten minutes to enter and ran in microseconds. The ratio of effort to result was absurd, but the thrill of making the machine *do something* was electric.

**Kill the Bit:**

The most famous Altair front-panel program was "Kill the Bit" — a game where a single LED lit up and "ran" across the front panel. The player had to toggle the corresponding switch at exactly the right moment to "kill" the bit (turn off the LED). If you missed, the bit escaped to the next position. It was perhaps the simplest video game ever created — one LED, one switch, no screen — but it was genuinely fun and became a shared experience among early microcomputer enthusiasts.

**Birth of Microsoft:**

When Harvard student Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen saw the Altair cover, they called MITS and claimed to have a BASIC interpreter ready. They didn't — but they wrote one in eight weeks, and Micro-Soft (as it was initially hyphenated) was born. The Altair BASIC they delivered was the first product from what would become the world's largest software company.

**Our simulator:** Renders the full Altair front panel with address and data LEDs in octal grouping, toggle switches controlled by the keyboard, and all standard operations (EXAMINE, DEPOSIT, DEPOSIT NEXT, RUN, STOP, LOAD ADDRESS). Pre-loaded programs include a counter, LED chaser, and Kill the Bit. The PDP-8 and IMSAI 8080 variants are also available.

## Home Computer Revolution (1977-1985)

In 1975, computers were for companies and hobbyists with soldering irons. By 1985, they were in millions of homes. The home computer revolution was the most dramatic democratization of technology since the printing press. And the interface — for almost every one of these machines — was a BASIC prompt.

You turned on the machine. You saw a copyright notice, a memory count, and `READY.` That was it. No desktop, no icons, no tutorial. Just a blinking cursor and the implicit invitation: *type something.*

An entire generation learned to program not because they chose to, but because there was nothing else to do with the machine. Want to play a game? Type it in from a magazine listing. Want to draw something? Write a BASIC program. Want to make music? POKE the right memory addresses. The home computer taught a generation that computers were tools for *creation*, not just consumption. We have not fully recovered from the loss of that lesson.

### 12. Apple II (1977)

**Year**: June 1977
**Manufacturer**: Apple Computer, Cupertino, California
**Designers**: Steve Wozniak (hardware), Steve Jobs (concept/business)
**CPU**: MOS 6502 @ 1.023 MHz
**Memory**: 4 KB standard, expandable to 48 KB (later 64 KB with Language Card)
**Display**: 40×24 text, 280×192 hi-res graphics (6 colors)
**Price**: $1,298 (about $6,500 today)
**BASIC**: Applesoft BASIC (Microsoft-authored, in ROM)

The Apple II wasn't the first personal computer, but it was the first one that felt like a *product* rather than a project. Steve Wozniak's hardware design was elegant — he achieved with 60 chips what other designers needed 150 for. Steve Jobs insisted on a proper case, a keyboard, and a power supply that didn't require a fan. The result was a machine that a normal person could bring home, plug in, and use.

**The green screen:**

The classic Apple II experience was Applesoft BASIC on a green phosphor monitor. The machine had no lowercase characters in its original ROM — everything was uppercase, displayed in the distinctive Apple II font on a 40-column screen. The green-on-black aesthetic of the Apple II, with its clean character shapes and steady phosphor glow, became one of the defining images of early personal computing.

When you turned on an Apple II, you were dropped directly into the monitor ROM at the `*` prompt. Typing `Ctrl-B` (or just booting normally with Applesoft ROM) brought you to the BASIC prompt: `]`. That right-bracket prompt is one of the most recognizable symbols in computing history.

**VisiCalc:**

The Apple II's killer app was VisiCalc (1979), the first electronic spreadsheet. VisiCalc was so revolutionary that businesses bought Apple IIs specifically to run it — the first time a personal computer was purchased as a serious business tool rather than a hobby. VisiCalc demonstrated that personal computers could do real work, and it kept the Apple II commercially viable for years longer than its hardware specs would have otherwise allowed.

**Impact:**

More than five million Apple IIs were sold over the platform's lifetime (1977-1993). It was the machine that Apple built its empire on, and it established the Apple philosophy of integrated, user-friendly design that continues to this day.

**Our simulator:** Boots into Applesoft BASIC with the `]` prompt, uppercase only, 40-column display. Green phosphor CRT shader active. The BASIC interpreter supports standard Applesoft commands (PRINT, LET, IF/THEN, GOTO, FOR/NEXT, INPUT, GOSUB/RETURN).

### 13. Commodore PET (1977)

**Year**: January 1977 (announced), October 1977 (shipped)
**Manufacturer**: Commodore Business Machines, West Chester, Pennsylvania
**Designer**: Chuck Peddle
**CPU**: MOS 6502 @ 1 MHz
**Memory**: 8 KB (later models 32 KB)
**Display**: 40×25 text, built-in 9-inch green phosphor CRT
**Price**: $795 (about $4,000 today)
**BASIC**: Commodore BASIC (Microsoft-authored)

The PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) was the first all-in-one personal computer — keyboard, display, and cassette drive in a single unit. It looked like a piece of office equipment, not a hobbyist's experiment, and it found its way into schools, businesses, and government offices worldwide.

**The calculator keyboard:**

The original PET 2001 had a tiny, flat "chiclet" keyboard that was widely despised. The keys were small, cramped, and had almost no tactile feedback. Commodore fixed this in later models (the PET 2001-N and beyond), but the original keyboard remains one of the most infamous design decisions in computing history. Despite this, the PET sold well because the machine itself was capable and well-priced.

**PETSCII:**

The PET used PETSCII (PET Standard Code of Information Interchange), Commodore's proprietary character set that included extensive graphic symbols. The front of each keycap was printed with graphic symbols accessible via the shift key, allowing users to create surprisingly detailed images character by character. This "keyboard art" tradition was unique to Commodore machines and created a distinctive visual culture.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `*** COMMODORE BASIC ***` and `31743 BYTES FREE`, then `READY.` — the authentic PET startup. Green phosphor CRT shader active.

### 14. TRS-80 (1977)

**Year**: August 3, 1977
**Manufacturer**: Tandy Corporation / Radio Shack, Fort Worth, Texas
**CPU**: Zilog Z80 @ 1.77 MHz
**Memory**: 4 KB standard, expandable to 16 KB (later 48 KB)
**Display**: 64×16 text (Model I), white phosphor CRT
**Price**: $599 (about $3,000 today)
**BASIC**: Level II BASIC (Microsoft-authored)

The "Trash-80," as it was affectionately nicknamed, was the most successful of the 1977 trinity. Radio Shack's 3,000+ retail stores gave the TRS-80 a distribution channel that Apple and Commodore couldn't match. Within its first month, it outsold Tandy's production estimates for the entire year.

**The white phosphor:**

Unlike the Apple II and PET with their green displays, the TRS-80 shipped with a modified RCA black-and-white television that used white (P4) phosphor. This gave it a distinctive silvery appearance quite different from the green glow of its competitors. The white phosphor was technically more readable for text, but lacked the atmospheric quality that made green terminals so photogenic.

**Level II BASIC:**

The TRS-80's Level II BASIC was one of the best BASIC implementations of its era. Its `READY` prompt and `>` input marker were the first things a generation of hobbyists saw. The `MEMORY SIZE?` prompt at startup (which you could just press Enter to accept the default) and the `16383 BYTES FREE` message became embedded in memory for millions of users.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `RADIO SHACK LEVEL II BASIC`, the `MEMORY SIZE?` prompt, `16383 BYTES FREE`, and `READY` with the `>` prompt. White phosphor CRT shader active.

### 15. Commodore 64 (1982)

**Year**: August 1982
**Manufacturer**: Commodore Business Machines
**CPU**: MOS 6510 @ 1.023 MHz
**Memory**: 64 KB RAM, 20 KB ROM
**Display**: 40×25 text, 320×200 hi-res / 160×200 multicolor graphics
**Sound**: SID 6581 (3-voice synthesizer)
**Price**: $595 at launch, dropped to $199 by 1985
**BASIC**: Commodore BASIC V2
**Units sold**: ~17 million (Guinness record for best-selling single computer model)

The Commodore 64 is the best-selling single personal computer model in history. At its peak, it commanded between 30-40% of the US home computer market. It was in every department store, every computer shop, and millions of homes. It was the machine that defined the 8-bit generation.

**The blue screen:**

The C64's most distinctive visual feature was its default color scheme: light blue text on a dark blue background (specifically, "light blue" #887ECB on "blue" #50459B in the Pepto palette). This blue-on-blue scheme was unique among home computers, most of which defaulted to light-on-dark (typically green or white on black). When a generation thinks "Commodore 64," they see blue.

The boot sequence was iconic:

```
    **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****

 64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

READY.
```

That `38911 BASIC BYTES FREE` number (out of 65536 total) accounted for the BASIC interpreter, the operating system (Kernal), and the character ROM consuming the rest. Every C64 owner had that number burned into their memory.

**The SID chip:**

The C64's sound chip (SID 6581, designed by Bob Yannes) was a genuine three-voice synthesizer with ADSR envelopes, ring modulation, and a programmable filter. It was so far ahead of the competition that it spawned an entire music scene. Composers like Rob Hubbard, Martin Galway, and Jeroen Tel created works of art using three voices and a filter, and the SID music scene (the "demoscene") continues to this day. The SID chip is arguably the single most culturally important component in computing history.

**The Pepto palette:**

The C64's 16-color palette was fixed in hardware by the VIC-II video chip. The exact colors have been a subject of decades-long debate and meticulous measurement. The "Pepto" palette (named after the researcher who measured the colors directly from the VIC-II chip) is now considered the most accurate representation and is the one used in our simulator.

**Our simulator:** Boots with the exact C64 startup screen, using the Pepto color palette. The BASIC interpreter is configured for Commodore BASIC V2 with the `READY.` prompt. The CRT shader is active without phosphor tinting (color display), preserving the authentic blue-on-blue.

### 16. ZX Spectrum (1982)

**Year**: April 23, 1982
**Manufacturer**: Sinclair Research, Cambridge, England
**Designer**: Sir Clive Sinclair (concept), Richard Altwasser (hardware), Steven Vickers (ROM)
**CPU**: Zilog Z80A @ 3.5 MHz
**Memory**: 16 KB or 48 KB
**Display**: 32×24 text, 256×192 graphics with 8×8 attribute cells
**Price**: £125 for 16K, £175 for 48K (about £400/£560 today)
**BASIC**: Sinclair BASIC

The ZX Spectrum was the computer that created the British gaming industry. Cheap enough for a working-class family to afford, it was wildly popular in the UK, Europe, and the Soviet Union (where countless clones were produced). More than five million were sold, and it launched the careers of countless game developers, musicians, and programmers.

**Keyword entry:**

The Spectrum had the most unusual BASIC entry system of any home computer. Instead of typing keywords letter by letter, each key was mapped to a complete BASIC keyword. In "keyword mode" (the default at the start of a line), pressing `P` typed `PRINT`, pressing `G` typed `GOTO`, pressing `R` typed `RUN`. This served two purposes: it prevented syntax errors (you couldn't misspell `PRINT`) and it was much faster than typing keywords character by character on the Spectrum's notoriously small rubber keyboard.

The system used context-sensitive modes — keyword mode, letter mode, and graphics mode — indicated by cursor changes (K for keyword, L for letter, C for capital, G for graphics). It was confusing at first but efficient once mastered.

**Attribute clash:**

The Spectrum's display used 8×8 pixel "attribute cells," each of which could have only one foreground and one background color. This meant that when two differently-colored objects overlapped within the same 8×8 cell, one color would "win" — creating the characteristic "color clash" artifacts that defined the Spectrum's visual style. Game developers worked around this limitation with extraordinary creativity.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `(c) 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd` and implements the keyword entry mode — press P for PRINT, G for GOTO, R for RUN, and so on. The distinctive reversed-video cursor behavior is simulated.

### 17. BBC Micro (1981)

**Year**: December 1981
**Manufacturer**: Acorn Computers, Cambridge, England
**CPU**: MOS 6502A @ 2 MHz
**Memory**: 16 KB (Model A) or 32 KB (Model B)
**Display**: Multiple modes, up to 80×32 text or 640×256 graphics
**Price**: £299 (Model A) / £399 (Model B)
**BASIC**: BBC BASIC

The BBC Micro was created for the BBC Computer Literacy Project — a national initiative to teach Britain about computers. Acorn Computers won the contract, and the result was one of the finest 8-bit computers ever designed. It was technically superior to most of its competitors and became the standard in British schools for a decade.

**BBC BASIC:**

BBC BASIC was arguably the best BASIC implementation on any 8-bit computer. It supported structured programming (named procedures with `DEF PROC`/`ENDPROC`, proper `IF...THEN...ELSE`), inline assembler for the 6502, and long variable names. While other BASICs taught bad habits (everything in global scope, line numbers as spaghetti glue), BBC BASIC taught real programming concepts.

The `>` prompt was distinctive — clean, minimal, professional. It reflected the machine's educational mandate: this was a *serious* tool that happened to be accessible.

**Acorn's legacy:**

The BBC Micro led Acorn to develop the ARM processor (originally "Acorn RISC Machine") in 1985. Today, ARM processors power essentially every smartphone on Earth, most tablets, and an increasing number of laptops and servers. The BBC Micro's descendant architecture runs more devices than any other processor design in history.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `BBC Computer 32K` / `Acorn DFS` / `BASIC` / `>` — the exact startup sequence. BBC BASIC is simulated through the universal BASIC interpreter.

### 18. Amstrad CPC (1984)

**Year**: June 1984
**Manufacturer**: Amstrad, Brentwood, Essex, England
**Designer**: Roland Perry (team lead)
**CPU**: Zilog Z80A @ 4 MHz
**Memory**: 64 KB (CPC 464) or 128 KB (CPC 6128)
**Display**: 80×25 (Mode 2, 2 colors) / 40×25 (Mode 1, 4 colors) / 20×25 (Mode 0, 16 colors)
**Price**: £249 with green monitor, £349 with color monitor
**BASIC**: Locomotive BASIC

Alan Sugar's Amstrad CPC was the computing everyman's computer. It came as a complete package — computer, monitor, and tape deck (or disk drive) all in one purchase. No need to buy a separate monitor or hope your TV had the right input. Open the box, plug it in, and go.

**The yellow-on-blue:**

The CPC's default Mode 1 display was yellow text on a dark blue background — a distinctive and unusual combination. Locomotive BASIC's `Ready` prompt (note the capitalization — not `READY` or `ready` but `Ready`) was unique among home computers.

**Locomotive BASIC:**

Locomotive BASIC was excellent — fast, full-featured, with good string handling and built-in graphics and sound commands. It supported `WHILE...WEND` loops, `DEF FN` for user-defined functions, and a comprehensive set of graphics primitives. For many users, it struck the right balance between power and accessibility.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `Amstrad 64K Microcomputer (v1)` and the Locomotive BASIC `Ready` prompt. Yellow-on-blue color scheme.

### 19. MSX (1983)

**Year**: June 1983 (standard announced); machines shipped October 1983
**Origin**: Japan (standard by ASCII Corporation and Microsoft)
**Designers**: Kazuhiko Nishi (ASCII Corp.) and Bill Gates (Microsoft)
**CPU**: Zilog Z80A @ 3.58 MHz
**Memory**: 32-64 KB RAM, 32 KB ROM
**Display**: TMS9918A video, 256×192, 16 colors
**BASIC**: MSX-BASIC (Microsoft)

MSX was an attempt to create a universal standard for home computers — "Machines with Software eXchangeability." Led by Kazuhiko Nishi of ASCII Corporation in partnership with Microsoft, the MSX standard was adopted by dozens of manufacturers (Sony, Panasonic, Philips, Yamaha, and many others). The idea was simple: any MSX software would run on any MSX machine, regardless of manufacturer.

**Global phenomenon:**

While MSX never gained traction in the United States (where the Commodore 64 dominated), it was enormously successful in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands, and other markets. In Japan, MSX was *the* home computer of the 1980s, and many Japanese game developers (including Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear) got their start on MSX.

The MSX-BASIC prompt (`Ok`) and its `MSX BASIC version 1.0 / Copyright 1983 by Microsoft` startup were familiar to millions of users across dozens of countries, making MSX perhaps the most internationally diverse computing platform before the IBM PC compatible.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `MSX BASIC version 1.0` / `Copyright 1983 by Microsoft` / `28815 Bytes free` / `Ok`. White-on-blue color scheme using the TMS9918A-derived palette.

### 20. Atari 800 (1979)

**Year**: November 1979
**Manufacturer**: Atari, Inc., Sunnyvale, California
**CPU**: MOS 6502 @ 1.79 MHz
**Memory**: 8 KB, expandable to 48 KB
**Display**: Multiple modes, ANTIC/GTIA chips, up to 320×192, 128 colors
**Price**: $999 at launch (about $4,200 today)
**BASIC**: Atari BASIC (cartridge)

The Atari 800 was designed by the team that created the Atari 2600 game console, and it showed. The machine's custom chips (ANTIC for display lists, CTIA/GTIA for graphics, POKEY for sound and I/O) were years ahead of the competition. The hardware could do scrolling, display list interrupts, and player/missile graphics that other machines needed software to achieve.

**The cartridge slot:**

Atari BASIC came on a cartridge that plugged into the front of the machine. If you powered on without the cartridge, you got the "Memo Pad" — a simple text editor with no programming capability. With the cartridge inserted, you got the familiar `READY` prompt. This cartridge-based approach meant BASIC didn't consume any RAM, leaving the full memory available for programs.

**The spartan boot:**

The Atari 800's BASIC boot was the most minimal of any home computer: just `READY`. No banner, no copyright, no memory count. Just `READY` and a cursor. It was stark and a little intimidating — you were on your own.

**Our simulator:** Boots with the minimalist `READY` prompt — true to the Atari 800's character.

### 21. Commodore Amiga (1985)

**Year**: July 23, 1985
**Manufacturer**: Commodore-Amiga, Inc. (originally Amiga Corporation)
**Designers**: Jay Miner (lead), RJ Mical, Dave Needle, and team
**CPU**: Motorola 68000 @ 7.16 MHz
**Memory**: 256 KB (A1000), 512 KB (A500), expandable
**Display**: Up to 640×400, 4096 colors (HAM mode)
**Sound**: Paula — 4 channel, 8-bit, stereo PCM
**Price**: $1,295 (A1000), $699 (A500)
**OS**: AmigaOS with Workbench GUI

The Amiga was a technological marvel that arrived at the wrong time, was sold by the wrong company, and never received the recognition it deserved during its lifetime. In 1985, it had preemptive multitasking, a fully graphical windowing system, hardware-accelerated graphics with 4096 colors, and four-channel stereo sound. The IBM PC wouldn't match these capabilities until the early 1990s. The Macintosh wouldn't until later still.

**The custom chips:**

Jay Miner (the "father of the Amiga") designed a set of custom chips — Agnus (DMA and display controller), Denise (color and sprite engine), and Paula (audio and I/O) — that worked together through a sophisticated coprocessor system. The "Copper" coprocessor could change display parameters on every scanline, enabling visual effects that seemed impossible on a home computer.

**AmigaDOS and the CLI:**

While the Amiga had the Workbench GUI, power users lived in the CLI (Command Line Interface) or its successor, the Shell. The `1.RAM:>` prompt indicated you were in the RAM disk — a portion of memory formatted as a fast temporary filesystem. AmigaDOS commands followed a hybrid of Unix and CP/M conventions.

**Cultural impact:**

The Amiga became the foundation of the desktop video revolution, the demoscene, and early multimedia. Babylon 5's visual effects were created on Amigas. Andy Warhol used an Amiga to create digital art at the machine's 1985 launch event (painting a portrait of Debbie Harry). NewTek's Video Toaster turned the Amiga into a broadcast-quality video production system.

**Our simulator:** Boots into AmigaDOS with `AmigaDOS V3.1` and the Workbench copyright. The classic blue-and-orange Workbench color scheme is applied. The Unix shell simulator provides the CLI experience.

## IBM PC Era (1981-1995)

On August 12, 1981, IBM entered the personal computer market and changed everything. The IBM PC wasn't the best personal computer — it wasn't even close. But it was made by *IBM*, and that meant corporations would buy it. The IBM PC's open architecture (an anomaly for IBM) spawned an ecosystem of clones, and "IBM PC compatible" became the default platform for business computing worldwide.

### 22. IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (1981)

**Year**: August 1981 (with the IBM PC)
**Manufacturer**: IBM
**Display**: 80×25 text, monochrome only (no graphics)
**CRT**: IBM 5151 green phosphor monitor (later amber third-party monitors)
**Character set**: IBM Code Page 437 (box-drawing characters)
**Type**: Text-only display adapter

The MDA was IBM's "serious" display option for the original PC. While the CGA offered color and graphics, the MDA offered razor-sharp text at 720×350 resolution — significantly higher than CGA's 640×200. For word processing, spreadsheets, and programming, the MDA's crisp green characters on the 5151 monitor were superior to anything CGA could produce.

**Code Page 437:**

The MDA (and CGA) shipped with IBM Code Page 437 — an extended ASCII character set that included box-drawing characters (single and double line), mathematical symbols, and block elements. This character set became the visual language of DOS applications: every menu, every dialog box, every text-mode user interface was built from these characters. The box-drawing characters (`┌─┐│└─┘` and their double-line variants `╔═╗║╚═╝`) are still used today in terminal UIs.

**The DOS prompt:**

The IBM PC with MDA was where `C:\>` became iconic. The blinking underscore cursor, the green phosphor glow, the `DIR` listing scrolling past — this was the daily experience of millions of business computer users throughout the 1980s. IBM DOS (which was actually Microsoft's MS-DOS with IBM's branding) presented a `C:\>` prompt that became the universal symbol for "computer."

**Our simulator:** Boots into DOS 3.30 with authentic IBM branding, green phosphor CRT shader, and the full DOS command set. The virtual filesystem includes C:\DOS, C:\GAMES, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and CONFIG.SYS.

---

### 23. IBM Color Graphics Adapter (1981)

**Year**: August 1981 (with the IBM PC)
**Manufacturer**: IBM
**Display**: 80×25 or 40×25 text; 320×200 (4 colors) or 640×200 (2 colors) graphics
**Colors**: 16 text colors, 4 graphics colors (from fixed palettes)
**Type**: Color display adapter

CGA brought color to the IBM PC — sort of. The graphics modes were limited (320×200 with an ugly fixed palette of cyan/magenta/white, or 640×200 in monochrome), and the text mode, while colorful, was less sharp than the MDA. The adapter connected to either an RGB monitor (the IBM 5153) or a composite display (including televisions), with dramatically different results.

**The CGA palette:**

CGA's 16 text-mode colors became the standard palette for DOS computing:

```
0: Black         8: Dark Gray
1: Blue          9: Light Blue
2: Green        10: Light Green
3: Cyan         11: Light Cyan
4: Red          12: Light Red
5: Magenta      13: Light Magenta
6: Brown        14: Yellow
7: Light Gray   15: White
```

This palette (with minor variations) was carried forward through EGA, VGA, and into Windows. When you see ANSI terminal colors, you're looking at descendants of the CGA palette.

**Our simulator:** Boots into DOS 3.30 with the full 16-color CGA palette. The CRT shader is active without phosphor tinting (color display).

### 24. MS-DOS (1981-1994)

**Year**: August 1981 (version 1.0) through 1994 (version 6.22)
**Developer**: Microsoft (originally Seattle Computer Products' 86-DOS)
**Final version**: 6.22 (June 1994)
**Type**: Command-line operating system

MS-DOS was the operating system that Microsoft built its empire on. For over a decade, it was the default operating system on the majority of the world's personal computers. It was simple (no multitasking, no memory protection, 640 KB conventional memory limit), it was fragile (one misbehaving program could crash the entire system), and it was enormously successful.

**AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS:**

Every DOS user knew these two files. `CONFIG.SYS` loaded device drivers and set system parameters at boot time; `AUTOEXEC.BAT` ran commands automatically after boot. Configuring these files — loading the right memory managers (`HIMEM.SYS`, `EMM386.EXE`), setting path variables, loading TSR programs — was a dark art. The quest to free up enough conventional memory (below 640 KB) to run games while still having mouse drivers and sound card support loaded was a puzzle that consumed millions of person-hours.

```
# CONFIG.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
DOS=HIGH,UMB
FILES=30
BUFFERS=20

# AUTOEXEC.BAT
@ECHO OFF
PROMPT $P$G
PATH=C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS
SET TEMP=C:\TEMP
```

These files became part of computing folklore. "Did you edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT?" was a universal troubleshooting question of the era.

**The command line:**

DOS commands — `DIR`, `CD`, `TYPE`, `COPY`, `DEL`, `REN`, `MKDIR`, `RMDIR`, `CLS` — were the vocabulary of everyday computing. `DIR /W` for wide listing, `DIR /P` for paged output, `CD ..` to go up a directory. These commands were so deeply ingrained that they influenced Windows forever (the Windows command prompt still supports them all).

**Our simulator:** Implements DOS 6.22 with a virtual filesystem containing AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and pre-populated directories. All major commands work: DIR, CD, TYPE, COPY, DEL, REN, MKDIR, RMDIR, CLS, VER, DATE, TIME, MEM (showing conventional and extended memory), TREE, and HELP.

## Professional Workstations (1980s-1990s)

While home computers and PCs dominated the consumer market, a different world of computing existed in universities, research labs, animation studios, and corporate data centers. These were the workstations — powerful machines running sophisticated Unix variants, with high-resolution displays and networking capabilities that consumer hardware wouldn't match for years.

### 25. Sun Solaris (1992)

**Year**: SunOS 1.0 (1983); Solaris 1.0 (1992); Solaris 2.5-2.6 (peak era, 1996-97)
**Manufacturer**: Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, California
**Founders**: Andy Bechtolsheim, Vinod Khosla, Bill Joy, Scott McNealy
**CPU**: SPARC (Sun's own RISC architecture)
**OS**: SunOS (BSD-based) / Solaris (SVR4-based)
**Type**: Unix workstation

Sun Microsystems was built on a radical idea: "The Network Is The Computer." In an era when computing was still mostly standalone, Sun built machines designed from the ground up for networking. Their workstations ran NFS (Network File System, invented at Sun), used NIS for distributed authentication, and were connected via Ethernet long before home users had heard of the internet.

**The OpenBoot PROM:**

Sun workstations booted through OpenBoot (also known as Open Firmware), which presented the `ok` prompt — a Forth-based firmware environment. The `ok boot disk` command was how you started a Sun workstation. This was a powerful environment in itself — you could test hardware, configure boot devices, and even write small programs at the firmware level.

**The SPARC architecture:**

Sun's SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) was one of the first open RISC architectures. It was fast, scalable, and elegantly designed. SPARC workstations were the machines that ran early internet infrastructure, served the first websites, and powered the scientific computing that made the 1990s tech revolution possible.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `ok boot disk`, displays the SunOS Release 5.6 banner, and provides a Unix shell with era-appropriate commands and filesystem.

### 26. SGI IRIX (1988)

**Year**: IRIX 1.0 (1988); IRIX 6.5 (1998, the iconic version)
**Manufacturer**: Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), Mountain View, California
**Founder**: Jim Clark
**CPU**: MIPS R-series processors
**Type**: High-end graphics workstation

SGI machines were the Ferraris of the computing world — beautiful, expensive, and devastatingly powerful. They were the machines that rendered Jurassic Park's dinosaurs, Toy Story's animation, and the virtual reality sequences in *The Lawnmower Man*. If you worked in visual effects, scientific visualization, or 3D modeling in the 1990s, you worked on an SGI.

**The Octane:**

The SGI Octane (1997) was perhaps the most iconic SGI workstation — a strikingly designed machine with a distinctive blue-purple chassis. Running IRIX 6.5, it could handle 3D rendering, video editing, and scientific visualization that would bring lesser machines to their knees. The Octane was the machine on desks at Industrial Light & Magic, Pixar, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

**IRIX:**

IRIX was SGI's Unix variant, based on UNIX System V with BSD extensions. It was known for its advanced graphics subsystem (OpenGL was essentially codified from SGI's proprietary GL), its real-time capabilities, and its sophisticated filesystem (XFS, which later became the default filesystem for Red Hat Enterprise Linux). The IRIX desktop used the "4Dwm" window manager with SGI's distinctive purple-and-gray aesthetic.

**Cultural impact:**

SGI machines didn't just contribute to Hollywood — they appeared in it. In *Jurassic Park* (1993), the girl who hacks the door locks exclaims "This is a Unix system! I know this!" while using SGI's File System Navigator (fsn), a 3D filesystem browser that actually existed (and was later recreated as open source). The scene is one of the most famous computer interfaces in cinema history.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `IRIX Release 6.5 IP30` (the Octane's hardware platform) and the SGI copyright. The Unix shell provides an era-appropriate environment.

### 27. NeXTSTEP (1989)

**Year**: September 18, 1989 (1.0); NeXTSTEP 3.3 (1995)
**Manufacturer**: NeXT, Inc., Redwood City, California
**Founder**: Steve Jobs (after leaving Apple)
**CPU**: Motorola 68030/68040 (original); later Intel x86
**Display**: 17-inch MegaPixel Display (1120×832, 4-bit grayscale)
**Price**: $6,500 (about $16,000 today)
**Type**: Object-oriented Unix workstation

When Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he founded NeXT Computer with the goal of building the perfect academic workstation. The result was a machine so far ahead of its time that its influence shapes computing to this day.

**The black cube:**

The NeXT Computer was a perfect one-foot magnesium cube, painted matte black. It was beautiful, expensive, and impractical — but it ran the most advanced operating system in the world. NeXTSTEP was a Mach-based Unix system with a fully object-oriented user interface built on Objective-C, the Display PostScript graphics system, and the first truly modern development environment (Interface Builder, which is still used in Apple's Xcode today).

**The World Wide Web:**

Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web on a NeXT Computer at CERN in 1989-1991. The first web server, the first web browser (WorldWideWeb.app), and the first web page all ran on NeXTSTEP. The machine's advanced development environment made it possible for Berners-Lee to create the web as a side project in a matter of months. The NeXT cube that served the first website is now displayed at CERN with a note attached: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"

**Apple's return:**

Apple acquired NeXT in 1997 for $429 million, bringing Steve Jobs back to Apple and NeXTSTEP's technology with him. macOS is the direct descendant of NeXTSTEP — the Objective-C runtime, the .app bundle format, the Dock, Core Animation, Interface Builder, and many other macOS technologies originated in NeXTSTEP. Every Mac, iPhone, and iPad runs software whose ancestry traces directly to the NeXT cube.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `NeXTSTEP Release 3.3` and a startup sequence showing disk check, network, and Window Server initialization. The grayscale aesthetic is captured through the color palette.

## The BBS Era (1978-1999)

### 28. BBS Terminal (1978-1999)

**Year**: First BBS: February 16, 1978 (CBBS, Chicago)
**Creators**: Ward Christensen and Randy Suess (CBBS)
**Type**: Dial-up bulletin board system
**Peak**: Late 1980s to mid-1990s (~150,000 BBSes in North America by 1995)
**Connection**: 300 baud to 56K modem (typical: 14,400 baud in the early 1990s)

Before the World Wide Web, before social media, before forums — there were BBSes. Bulletin Board Systems were the internet before the internet: local, community-run, dial-up services where people posted messages, shared files, played games, and formed communities. The BBS era was the most democratic period in computing history. Anyone with a computer, a modem, and a phone line could run one.

**The ritual:**

Connecting to a BBS was a ritual. You launched your terminal program (TELIX, Procomm, QMODEM), typed `ATDT` followed by the phone number, and waited. The modem dialed — you could hear the tones if your modem had a speaker. Then came the handshake: a burst of electronic screeching as the two modems negotiated their connection speed. `CONNECT 14400` meant success. The screen would fill with the BBS's welcome screen — usually elaborate ANSI art with the board's name, sysop credits, and a login prompt.

```
ATDT 555-0199

RING...
RING...

CONNECT 14400/ARQ/V.32bis/LAPM
```

**ANSI art:**

BBS culture produced a unique art form: ANSI art, created using the extended IBM character set (Code Page 437) and ANSI color codes. Artists in groups like ACiD, iCE, and Remorse created elaborate, colorful images using only text characters. The best ANSI art was stunning — detailed landscapes, portraits, and logos rendered in a 80×25 grid of colored characters. ANSI art competitions were taken as seriously as any gallery show.

**Door games:**

BBSes ran "door games" — external programs that BBS users could play. Trade Wars 2002, Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD), Barren Realms Elite, and Usurper were among the most popular. These were multiplayer games — played asynchronously, with each player getting a limited number of turns per day. The social dynamics were intense; alliances formed, rivalries burned, and the leaderboard was serious business.

**The community:**

BBS culture was inherently local. Since you were paying for a phone call, you typically called BBSes in your area code. This meant BBS communities were geographically local — you might meet fellow users at "GT" (get-togethers). The sysop (system operator) was a known figure, often hosting the BBS on their personal computer in their bedroom or basement. The relationship between sysop and users was personal in a way that modern internet services can never replicate.

**The end:**

When affordable internet access arrived in the mid-1990s (especially after the launch of America Online's flat-rate pricing in 1996), BBS culture rapidly declined. Why call a local board at 14.4K when you could access the entire internet at 28.8K or higher? By 2000, the great BBS era was over. But its influence persists in internet culture: forums, social media, online gaming, file sharing, and the very concept of "logging in" to a community all descend from BBS culture.

**Our simulator:** The full experience: modem dial and connect, ANSI art welcome screen, login, main menu with message bases (read and post messages), file areas (with download progress bars), a text adventure door game (Dragon's Lair), user stats, and the classic `NO CARRIER` disconnect.

## The Modern Dawn (1990s)

### 29. Early Linux (1991-1998)

**Year**: August 25, 1991 (Linus Torvalds' announcement); Slackware 3.6 (1998)
**Creator**: Linus Torvalds (kernel); Patrick Volkerding (Slackware)
**Type**: Free Unix-like operating system

On August 25, 1991, a 21-year-old Finnish computer science student posted a message to the comp.os.minix newsgroup:

> *"Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(AT) clones."*

That student was Linus Torvalds, and his "hobby" became the most important operating system of the 21st century.

**LILO and the boot sequence:**

Early Linux booted through LILO (LInux LOader), which displayed `LILO boot:` and waited for the user to type the label of the kernel to load (usually just `linux`). Then came the kernel messages — a rapid scroll of hardware detection, driver initialization, and filesystem checks. Reading the Linux boot messages became a skill: experienced administrators could diagnose hardware problems by watching which messages appeared (or didn't).

```
LILO boot: linux
Loading linux...
Linux version 2.0.36 (root@linux) (gcc 2.7.2.3)
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25, 1 virtual console (max 63)
Calibrating delay loop.. 53.04 BogoMIPS
```

The "BogoMIPS" measurement (a portmanteau of "bogus" and "MIPS") was Linus's joke — a deliberately meaningless benchmark that nonetheless became one of the most recognized numbers in Linux culture.

**Slackware:**

By the mid-1990s, Slackware was the Linux distribution for serious users. Created by Patrick Volkerding in 1993, Slackware was simple, stable, and uncompromising. It didn't hold your hand — you were expected to understand what you were doing. Installing Slackware from a stack of floppy disks (or later, a CD) and getting X Windows working was a rite of passage. If you could install Slackware, you could call yourself a Linux user.

**The cultural moment:**

Linux in the late 1990s was at an inflection point. It had proven itself reliable (many early ISPs ran on Linux), it had a passionate community, and it was beginning to attract corporate attention. But it was still firmly in the domain of experts. The stereotype of the Linux user — up at 3 AM, compiling kernels, reading man pages, IRC open in one terminal and Vim in another — was not entirely inaccurate. These were the people who took the red pill before Neo made it cool.

**Our simulator:** Boots through LILO with an authentic kernel 2.0.36 startup sequence, hardware detection messages, and a `Welcome to Slackware Linux 3.6` banner. The Unix shell provides a classic command-line environment.

### 30. Windows 98 (1998)

**Year**: June 25, 1998
**Developer**: Microsoft
**Type**: Consumer operating system (DOS-based with GUI)
**Significance**: The last mainstream OS before the Matrix's 1999

Windows 98 was the world that *The Matrix* was rebelling against. While the film showed green terminals and raw code, most computer users in 1999 were staring at a teal desktop with a Start button. Windows 98 was comfortable, familiar, and ubiquitous — and it hid the machine completely.

**The DOS underneath:**

But beneath the graphical surface, Windows 98 was still DOS. You could press F8 at boot to get to a command prompt. You could open a DOS window and navigate `C:\WINDOWS>` with the same commands that worked in 1981. The machine was still there, under the abstraction. Windows 98 was the blue pill — a comfortable illusion built on top of the same text-mode reality that had always existed.

**The 1999 desktop:**

When *The Matrix* was released, the typical computer user's experience was:
- Windows 98 desktop with icons
- Internet Explorer 4 or 5
- 56K dial-up modem
- 800×600 resolution, 256 colors (or 65,536 if lucky)
- Solitaire, Minesweeper, and whatever AOL offered
- "You've Got Mail"

This was the simulation. The comfortable, GUI-mediated experience that hid the reality of processes, filesystems, and network protocols behind icons and dialog boxes. Neo's journey — from computer user to terminal operator to seeing raw code — was a metaphor for moving from Windows to the command line to understanding the machine itself.

**Our simulator:** Boots with `Starting Windows 98...` and drops to `C:\WINDOWS>` — the DOS prompt that lived beneath the GUI. The DOS command simulator provides the authentic experience of opening a DOS window on a Windows 98 machine.

## Return to the Matrix (1999)

After traveling through 55 years of computing history — from hand-wired cipher machines to graphical operating systems — you arrive back at 1999. Back at the green rain. Back at the terminal that sees through the illusion.

The Matrix theme is the final era, but it's also the first. It's the default state of this project. Green phosphor on near-black. CRT curvature and scanlines. The digital rain of half-width katakana characters. The typing effect: *"Wake up, Neo..."*

Every era in this collection is a step on the path to this moment. The Enigma machine was a cipher — a way of hiding truth. Colossus was built to break that cipher — to reveal truth. The punch card was a physical encoding of thought. The teletype was thought made audible. The CRT was thought made visible. The home computer was thought made personal. The internet was thought made universal.

And then, in 1999, a film asked the question that all this technology had been building toward: *What if the interface isn't showing you reality? What if it's hiding it?*

The terminal is where you go to find out.

Select "Return to Matrix" in the Terminal Eras menu (press `m`) to come home.

*"I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin."* — Neo

# Part III: The Technology

## How Phosphors Work

A phosphor is a substance that emits light when struck by an electron beam. In a CRT, the electron gun fires a focused beam at the inside surface of the glass screen, which is coated with phosphor material. When the electrons hit the phosphor, it absorbs the energy and re-emits it as visible light.

Different phosphor compounds emit different colors:

| Phosphor Type | Color | Peak Wavelength | Persistence | Primary Use |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1** (ZnS:Mn + ZnSiO4:Mn) | Green | 525 nm | Medium-long | Oscilloscopes, early terminals |
| **P4** (ZnS:Ag + ZnCdS:Ag) | White | Broadband | Short | Television, B&W monitors |
| **P31** (ZnS:Cu) | Green | 521 nm | Medium-short | CRT terminals (most common) |
| **P39** (ZnCdS:Ag + ZnS:Ag) | Green | 525 nm | Long | Long-persistence terminal displays |
| **P3** (ZnCdS:Cu) | Amber/Yellow | 580 nm | Medium | Amber terminal displays |
| **P22** (various) | RGB triad | R/G/B | Short | Color CRT displays |

**Persistence** is key to the terminal experience. A phosphor's persistence is how long it continues to glow after the electron beam has moved on. Long-persistence phosphors (like P39, used in the IBM 3278) reduced flicker but caused visible "ghosting" — if you scrolled text quickly, you could see the afterimage of the previous text slowly fading. Short-persistence phosphors (like P4 in televisions) required higher refresh rates to prevent visible flicker.

The characteristic "glow" of a CRT terminal — reproduced by our bloom and CRT shaders — comes from two physical effects:
1. **Spot bloom**: The electron beam doesn't hit a perfect point; it has a Gaussian intensity profile that spreads slightly, making bright characters appear to glow
2. **Internal reflections**: Light from bright phosphor areas bounces off the glass face and internal coatings, creating a diffuse halo (halation)

## The CRT Display

A CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) works by firing electrons from a heated cathode through a focusing system and magnetic deflection coils onto a phosphor-coated glass screen. The key components:

1. **Electron gun**: A heated cathode emits electrons; a control grid varies the beam intensity (brightness); focus elements shape the beam
2. **Deflection coils**: Electromagnetic coils steer the beam horizontally (line by line) and vertically (field by field) across the screen
3. **Shadow mask** (color CRTs): A metal plate with tiny holes that ensure each electron beam hits only the correct colored phosphor dot
4. **Phosphor screen**: The inside surface of the glass, coated with phosphor material

**Scanlines** are an inherent feature of CRT displays. The electron beam scans horizontally across the screen, drawing one line at a time. The gap between adjacent lines — where no phosphor is excited — creates the characteristic dark bands visible at close range. Our CRT shaders reproduce this with darkened bands at the scale corresponding to the original display resolution.

**Barrel distortion** (the slight outward curvature of the image) occurs because the glass face of a CRT is curved. The beam travels different distances to the center versus the edges of the screen, causing the image to bow outward. Our shaders simulate this with a `CURVATURE` parameter.

**The vignette** (darkening at the edges) happens because the electron beam is weaker at the screen periphery — it has to travel farther and at a sharper angle, spreading out and losing intensity. Combined with the thicker glass at the edges of the curved screen, this creates the characteristic brightness falloff from center to corners.

## Character Encoding Through the Ages

The history of how computers represent text is the history of compromise:

| System | Encoding | Characters | Notable Features |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Hollerith | Punch card zones | 64 | Physical holes in paper |
| Baudot | 5-bit | 32 (with shift) | Used on teletypes |
| FIELDATA | 6-bit | 64 | US military standard |
| BCD | 6-bit | 64 | IBM mainframes |
| EBCDIC | 8-bit | 256 | IBM System/360 |

The Matrix's digital rain uses half-width katakana characters (Unicode block FF65-FF9F, originally from JIS X 0201), which is fitting — the computing history that leads to 1999 is also a history of character encoding, from holes punched in cards to Unicode code points cascading down a screen.

## The Sound of Computing

Each era had its own sound:

- **Enigma**: The mechanical click of rotor stepping, the buzz of the lampboard relay
- **Punch card**: The ka-chunk of the keypunch, the whir of the card reader
- **Teletype**: The rapid-fire clatter of the print mechanism, the ding of the carriage return bell
- **Line printer**: The sustained roar of the chain, varying in pitch with content
- **CRT terminal**: The 15.7 kHz horizontal scan whine, the click of the keyboard
- **Modem**: The DTMF dial tones, the handshake screech ("the sound of the internet")
- **Dot matrix printer**: The buzzing rasp of the print head, varying in pitch
- **Floppy drive**: The grinding seek and the click-click-click of reading tracks
- **Hard drive**: The mechanical chatter of the head actuator

These sounds were the ambient soundtrack of computing for decades. They represented computation as a *physical* process — something that made noise, generated heat, consumed power, and occupied space. The transition to silent solid-state computing eliminated these sounds but also eliminated the sensory connection to the machine. You could *hear* a computer working. You could *feel* it.

Our terminal eras can't reproduce sound through a terminal emulator, but the visual elements — the slow character output of the teletype, the scan of the line printer, the LED blinking of the front panel — capture the *rhythm* of these machines. Each era has its own tempo, its own sense of how fast (or slow) computation should feel.
